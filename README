# iceclient

iceclient connects to Icecast servers to either transmit (act as a source client
like ices) or recieve (act like a music player like winamp).  See Installation
for installing libshout for transmitting and JLayer for receiveing.

The newest version of this library should be available on github:
http://github.com/jblomo/iceclient

If this library is useful, or you have found bugs, please send a note to
http://github.com/jblomo/

See project.clj for version information.

## Usage

1. iceclient$ ../lein deps
2. If installing the dependencies fails, see Installation

### Transmit

1. Have a default installation of icecast running on localhost
2. iceclient$ ../lein repl
3. (use 'iceclient.transmit)
4. (test-shout "/path/to/song.mp3")

### Recieve

1. Follow Transmit instructions, or use a known working URL.
2. iceclient$ ../lein repl
3. (use 'iceclient.receive)
4. (play-url "http://localhost:8000/testshout.mp3")

## Installation

To transmit you must be able to load the libshout library with JNA.  This is
done by installing libshout from http://www.icecast.org/download.php and setting
jna.library.path to the directory where libshout was installed.

To receive you must have javazoom.net's JLayer library,
http://www.javazoom.net/javalayer/javalayer.html .  You can use mvn
install:install-file to install the jar into your local repository.
